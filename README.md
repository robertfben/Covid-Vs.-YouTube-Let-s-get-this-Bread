## Project Description/Outline: 

Our goal is to analyze a variety of trends of YouTube viewership during the height of the second U.S. COVID wave. We plan to use a dataset acquired from kaggle.com and the Google API for YouTube usage to determine a number of key factors around channel popularity, popular search trends by month, and total trending videos posted during the time period. 

The time period we are focusing our research on is data that ranges from 08/2020-08/2021 for a COVID time frame, as well as data from 09/2021-07/2022 for Post-COVID.

## Research Questions to Answer:

1) Popular trending videos analysis- based on likes, views, comments and dislikes
    - Based on our dataset, what are the chances of a video gaining popularity?
        - Bell curve of the 4 categories, visualizing a peak count of each column
        - Find outliers and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd standard deviations.

2) Popularity of video categories during covid
    - In the time period defined, which three video categories had the highest volume of videos posted?
        - For each category, what was the average view count per video?
        - Can we determine a correlation of like count to volume of views?

3) Video category analysis:
     - Which three video categories had the highest volume of videos posted? 
     - Did seasonality potentially drive content creators to post more? Out of the three categories with the highest volume of videos posted, which month did each category have the highest amount of videos posted?
          - Can we surmise any anecdotal conclusions based on the findings?
